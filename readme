files to change for adapting stratum corneum size

              change zmax in input.params to:
              0.2505 for 30um sc
              0.25 for 20um sc
              0.24975 for 15um sc
              0.2495 for 10um sc
              0.249 for 0um sc

              un-comment selected sc thickness layers in subs.f90 - make sure the rest are commented out

              select correct sc_width, sc_z_vox, z-face setup loop and opticalpropgrid subroutines(X2) in gridset.f90

              select correct k range in the normalising do loops in writer.f90 - also remember to change file name!

              select correct nzg value in constants.f90
